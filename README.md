# üç™ BisKit

BisKit is an iOS library to generate beautiful popups as the one featured when Apple Pencil is attached to the new iPad Pro.

![](demo.gif) 

...but you can also add other elements, that will be shown after the first animation. We call them _toppings_!

## Requirements

- Xcode 10 and later
- iOS 12 and later
- Swift 4.2 and later

## Installation

### Carthage

To install BisKit through Carthage, simply add this line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "ho0t/BisKit"
```

### CocoaPods

To install BisKit through CocoaPods, simply add this line to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'BisKit'
```

## Usage

### Basic

![](biskit_empty.png) 

To open a new `Biscuit`, create a new instance of `BiscuitViewController` and present it as a usual view controller:

```
let biscuit = BiscuitViewController(title: "My Pencil", timeout: 1.5)
self.present(biscuit, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

### Add toppings üç¨

If you want to add one or more toppings, create a new instance of `BiscuitViewController` by passing an array of `UIView`s into the initializers and present it as a usual view controller.

#### Built-in toppings

##### Label

![](biskit_text.png) 

```
let label = ToppingLabel(text: "Battery is low.")
let biscuit = BiscuitViewController(title: "My Pencil", timeout: 1.5)
self.present(biscuit, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

##### Battery

![](biskit_battery.png) 

```
let percentage = ToppingLabel(level: 0.5, batteryState: .charging) 
let biscuit = BiscuitViewController(title: "My Pencil", timeout: 1.5)
self.present(biscuit, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

## TODO

While the library is working, there are still some tasks to do, like:

- Writing tests
- Fix minor UI issues
- Create other built-in toppings
- etc.
